{"name":"Cents","tagline":"A Financial Decision Engine","body":"# Welcome to Cents, a Financial Decision Engine.\r\n### Note: This project is currently under development\r\nThe foundation of this idea is to help prepare potential college students for the realities of their educational choices. There are a lot of graduates that have entered the workforce with a large amount of debt and without the prospect of jobs to allow them to pay off that debt. \r\n\r\nOur tool would provide information, in a very intuitive way, that would allow a student to see how much debt they will accumulate, how much, on average they will make once they graduate and how their finances will breakdown with these two things in mind. Our service will expand to other important financial decisions that people make during their lives, including buying a house, buying a car, planning for and living in retirement and saving for a child’s education. The information they receive from our service will allow them to make an informed decision by providing basic cost/benefit analysis and giving a recommendation. \r\n\r\nIt is our hope to help people make wise decisions regarding their education by helping them understand the consequences of their decisions. The knowledge we are providing can be found by searching the internet but is usually generalized and non-intuitive. We hope to eliminate this barrier by allowing a user to retrieve information that is both specific to them and also easy to understand.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n Asaeli Junior Matelau (@matelau), Wesley Gormley (@wgormley), Michael Smith (@oakfield), and Austin Hammer (@hammeraj).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you're interested in partnering with us or contributing please drop us a line. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
